Someone said, "blog." I've been attempting to maintain a commit a day because of [Github](https://github.com/brimstone)'s stupid graph. This blog is an attempt to hack that. It's also an experiment in html5/spa (Single Page Apps)/misc screwing around with javascript and web design as a whole.

Also, this will probably document my learning in a new Operations role.

Only 13 days left.
