I'm really excited about this post. First my friend jimshoe linked me to [DAVdroid](https://f-droid.org/app/at.bitfire.davdroid). This should be able to replace the klugy caldav setup I have now for my phone. 

Second is [Sgit](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.sheimi.sgit). I should be able to use this to make commits from my phone while walking or on the train.

So excited!
