I'm apparently idle enough to attempt to start blogging/resurrect my wiki. I've moved the blog to MDWiki. Next up is to move the old mediawiki data into this as well. I really like how someone can simply `git clone` this blog/wiki and have all of it offline. Maybe I'll get some patches or merge requests.
