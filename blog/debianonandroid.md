Debian on Android

So, I tried Lil' Debi. That didn't seem to work. I tried Botbrew from Fdroid. That also acted funny. I tried to remove botbrew and guess what, apparently rm followed the symlink in /data/botbrew-basil/system to /system and nuked my rom. That was neat. Kinda. I wonder how many of my troubles are related to seandroid, the selinux port for android. More research is required.
