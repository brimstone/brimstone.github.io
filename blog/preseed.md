I'm slowly rebuilding my toolbox. Today was crafting an ubuntu preseed file, among many other things.  I ran across this guy's page about [the preseed file he uses for his VMs]( http://blog.dustinkirkland.com/2011/03/ubuntu-server-quick-install-no.html?m=1). I really like how he uses a bit.ly in the kernel cmdline from the CD.
