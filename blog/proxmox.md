Proxmox and Cryptoparty
-----------------------

I finally got to setup a VM on the proxmox box at freeside. Apparently proxmox really wants the bridges to be prefixed with 'vmbr'. I had some network issues with the VM for a bit, but the host seemed fine. I think it has to do with the way the bond is configured. I am now using bond mode 4 (whatever that is). Also happening at freeside was a Cryptoparty. It was neat listening to real live people have an intelligent conversation about cryptographic topics.
