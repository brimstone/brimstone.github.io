Advanced SIEM Optimization
--------------------------
@reliaquest
- Security Incident & Event Management
- Similar to IDS/IPS
- Different than ELK somehow
- Need to keep feeding a SIEM install
- SIEM systems injest syslog, web server logs, router logs, etc
- Don't flood people with alerts
- filter filter filter
- log DNS on your network, especially for mobile users
- log when VMs are created
- attribute DHCP activity to users
- is there a way to log mysql access denied errors?
- is it easy to scrape pastebin, twitter, or google for the company?
- regular nmap scans
- honeypots, honey hashes, canery files/records
- threat sharing programs: alienvault, facebook
- pcap parsing with nield
- use commercial feeds as "bad data" and try to recreate an attack under your own control
- know where your A records go
- monitor unused ip address ranges

Operationalizing Threat Intelligence
------------------------------------
- goes to cons to "maintain threat situatiinal awareness"
- iso iso iso
- more time documenting than anything else
- policy
- don't conflate Threat, Vulnerability, and Risk.
- Threat * Probability * Business Impact = Risk
- colors are important to management
- Do I need to stop normal patch policies to patch this vuln?

Malware Infection Visualized
