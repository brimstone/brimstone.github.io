I like his use of a MacBook Air in screenshot mode, hosting the screenshot on the right 2/3 of the screen, and a summary/logo on the left.

1. Maximize use of space on screen
1. Directional flow of information
1. Prioritization of content

Show bootstrap with simple row-fluid example. This is basic bootstrap with some extra css

Always use track by: <div ng-repeat="item in items track by item.id">

He says ng-resource is awesome. He recommends building your API for ng-resource, if you can.
