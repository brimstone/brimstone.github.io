Opening event
- Chaos Mentor program
- Chaos Macht Schule
- Freifunk refugee wifi program


What is the value of anonymous communication?
- Ethnographic Study
- 3 threats to Tor, most recent is websites blocking users
- many sites and CDNs blocking tor exit relays
- 3.5% of Alexa top 1000 sites blocked, 2.5% from cloudflare
- Wikipedia blocks users from editing
- Wikipedia editors making edits declining since 2007
- Wikimedia editors 87-91% male, depending on how you count
- Wikipedian of the year could not be revealed due to potential harm to the user
- John Gabriel's Greater Internet Dickwad Theory
- Antidotes are small batch artisanal data -- @pikelet
- "Easy" to out editors based on what they edit and say. 
- Users in good standing can get an IP exemption
- Map of active hate groups from Southern Poverty Law Center
- Wikipedia sued the NSA in March 2015
- Womens' heath and rights articles are highly contested
- I'm surprised by the amount of use of "googling" as a verb n quotes
- NSF grants used for this work


Towards reasonably trustworthy x86 laptops
*427F11FD 0FAA4B08 0123F01C DDFA1A3E 36879494*
- Qubes OS
- SPI flash is the most interesting element of modern architecture to this talk
- SPI chip contains many firmwares needed for operation of the system
- Intel ME(management engine?) is super scary
- State considered Harmful, probably the article I saw online a few weeks back
- She proposes a laptop with absolutely no writable storage.
- Moves the SPI flash to a Trusted Stick
- need to research coreboot


rad1o++
- did the r0cket at CCCamp11
- had to make another, couldn't be another arduino badge
- none available for purchase today, but a manufacturer is willing
- github.com/rad1o/f1rmware
- impressive demo of available firmwares, loadables, and apps
- live demo of wideband FM transceiver


How the Great Firewall discovers hidden Circumvention Server
- GFW blindly tries Tor handshake with external servers
- GFW probe sends non standard TLS handshake


microG Session
- https://github.com/microg
- device drivers, device services, manufacturer apps, google core, service apps and libs are not free
- Service apps
  - Google Services Framework
  - Network Location
  - Google Play Services
- microg provides
  - Network Location -> UnifiedNlp
  - Maps v1
  - Play Services
- Play Services provides strange APIs like the Panorama Stitcher
- IPC connection between library in app and services app is protected by app signatures, meaning the library will only talk to the app signed with the same cert. 
- microg currently supports enough to get Play Store working and some Google apps like Gmail
- for CM, need patch to fake sigs, could used xposed. Fakes sigs for Play Services and Play Store
- maps become osm in apps.
- push notifications still need to talk to google servers
- by default, microg's Play Services doesn't connect to Google services


Datahavens from HavenCo to today
- now works for Cloudflare
- great fiction list
- State of Texas kept driver licenses off shores because legally, they could only keep them them for a few years
- need to research ITAR
- pictures are amazing
- "If you could do the same in software, do that instead."
- Wikileaks insurance file is a nifty concept
- build apps that are message based, not connection based
- recommends watching zooko's zerocoin/zerocash

State of Internet Censorship
- There's a lot of censorship in the world still
- There's a lot of neat ways to monitor site and ISP censorship


CloudABI
- company is nuxi, unix in reverse byte order, cute
- speaker doesn't seem to be a fan of apparmor or selinux. Already got my vote. 
- FreeBSD is already using Capsicum, making the system capabilities based
- C library is not built for cap_enter(), urandom breaks, timezones break, localizations break, and more
- neat idea, open a listening tcp socket, and pass it to a server program as an interface
- https://github.com/nuxinl/cloudlibc
- only has 58 system calls, linux has over 300, bsd has over 400
- he has cross compilation tools for debian, ubuntu, freebsd, dragonfly bsd, and more
- he has packages for a bunch or distros too. This is a complicated project. 
- cloudabi: where everything is a fike descriptor
- `./ls < /etc`
- cloudabi-run executable < /executable-config.yaml


Advanced GnuPG
- no Perfect Forward Secrecy in OpenPGP
- streamed based, packet protocol, allows for low memory usage on a large body of data
- openpgp supports not revealing the id of the private key that can decode the data with an extension
- `| gpg2 --list-packets`
- public key contains preferred algorithms
- should be periodically exporting public key and pushing to keyservers
- GPG is not a library, GPGME(made easy) is a library
- these use process separation to isolate bugs in your software with GPG
- `pinentry` uses a simple, readable IPC called Assuan. Should use pinentry in other projects.
- recommends PGP Biometric word list and Voice of America's simple english wordlist over diceware's
- "key signing parties are for geeks"
- `gpg2 --with-icao-spelling --fingerprint ?`
- gpg supports tofu now, just like ssh
- should use something like `parcimonie` to refresh the public keys I know about.
- exclude .gnupg/random_seed from backups
- Always use a short expiration, built in failsafe revocation, forces users to refresh keys
- can use GnuPG and smartcard to provide ssh keys
- ssh -L can forward unix domain sockets!!!
- slides on gnupg.org
- recommend the GnuK smartcard
- FST-01 maybe?


State of GnuPG
- new default focus
  - mass surveillance
  - easy of use


Let's Encrypt
- CA/B forum is a thing
- CA/B is the group that makes the rules to add a CA to browsers, but browsers can choose to add on their own too
- Domain validation only, no plans for OV or EV
- no wildcards, but a cert can have up to 100 SANs
- already larger than startcom and wosign
- ~80% of domain names didn't have a record in the CT logs before
- there's a limit to 5 subdomains per .com, they have a hard limit on the number of certs they can sign
- the majority of people they work with use apache, that's why nginx has gotten the stick so far
- LE uses cf-ssl and a hardware module to sign certs


Perl Jam 2
- Got too much lip from the Perl Monks
- showed off exploit in Bugzilla because of assumption that CGI can't create hashes so they don't need to be escaped
- neat chart of how CGI.pm and modern CGI and how they all do different things
- programmers can't expect anything from their CGI parsers
- RCE in 5 lines of CGI.pm
- people love demos
- calls to stop using perl
- Someone from the audience asked to stop attacking perl. Answer stated that other languages improved when criticized, the perl community hasn't yet.


Grinding MMORPGs
- github.com/zhmu
- https://rink.nu
- Runes of Magic
- wanted to contribute a talk after seeing a talk last year
- romdump(1) tool he wrote is pretty cool, could be used in other games
- first wrote a decoder, then a proxy, then a server
- people love demos, even when they're silly and canned
- 2 years of work, maybe 4 to 6 months straight
- recommends that developers need to code keeping in mind that someone is going to get bored with the game and take it apart.
