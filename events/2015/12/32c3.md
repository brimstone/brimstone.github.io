What is the value of anonymous communication?

- many sites and CDNs blocking tor exit relays
- 3.5% of Alexa top 1000 sites blocked, 2.5% from cloudflaren
- Wikipedia blocks users from editing

- Wikimedia editors 87-91% male, depending on how you count
- Wikipedian of the year could not be revealed due to potential harm to the user
- John Gabriel's Greater Internet Dickwad Theory

Towards reasonably trustworthy x86 laptops
*427F11FD 0FAA4B08 0123F01C DDFA1A3E 36879494*
- Qubes OS
- SPI flash is the most interesting element of modern architecture to this talk
- SPI chip contains many firmwares needed for operation of the system
- Intel ME(management engine?) is super scary
- State considered Harmful, probably the article I saw online a few weeks back
- She proposes a laptop with absolutely no writable storage.
- Moves the SPI flash to a Trusted Stick
- need to research coreboot

rad1o++
- did the r0cket at CCCamp11
- had to make another, couldn't be another arduino badge
- none available for purchase today, but a manufacturer is willing
- github.com/rad1o/f1rmware
- impressive demo of available firmwares, loadables, and apps
- live demo of wideband FM transceiver

How the Great Firewall discovers hidden Circumvention Server
- GFW blindly tries Tor handshake with external servers
- GFW probe sends non standard TLS handshake

microG Session
- https://github.com/microg
- device drivers, device services, manufacturer apps, google core, service apps and libs are not free
- Service apps
  - Google Services Framework
  - Network Location
  - Google Play Services
- microg provides
  - Network Location -> UnifiedNlp
  - Maps v1
  - Play Services
- Play Services provides strange APIs like the Panorama Stitcher
- IPC connection between library in app and services app is protected by app signatures, meaning the librarh will onlh talk to the app signed with the same cert. 
- microg currently supports enough to get Play Store working and some Google apps like Gmail
- for CM, need patch to fake sigs, could used xposed. Fakes sigs for Play Services and Play Store
- maps become osm in apps.
- push notifications still need to talk to google servers
- by default, microg's Play Services doesn't connect to Google services

Datahavens from HavenCo to today
- now works for Cloudflare
- great fiction list
- State of Texas kept driver licenses off shores because legally, they could only keep them them for a few years
- need to research ITAR
- pictures are amazing
- "If you could do the same in software, do that instead."
- Wikileaks insurance file is a nifty concept
- build apps that are message based, not connection based
- recommends watching zooko's zerocoin/zerocash

State of Internet Censorship
- There's a lot of censorship in the world still
- There's a lot of neat ways to monitor site and ISP censorship

CloudABI
- company is nuxi, unix in reverse byte order, cute
- speaker doesn't seem to be a fan of apparmor or selinux. Already got my vote. 
- FreeBSD is already using Capsicum, making the system capabilities based
- C library is not built for cap_enter(), urandom breaks, timezones break, localizations break, and more
- neat idea, open a listening tcp socket, and pass it to a server program as an interface
- https://github.com/nuxinl/cloudlibc
- only has 58 system calls, linux has over 300, bsd has over 400
- he has cross compilation tools for debian, ubuntu, freebsd, dragonfly bsd, and more
- he has packages for a bunch or distros too. This is a complicated project. 
- cloudabi: where everything is a fike descriptor
- `./ls < /etc`
- cloudabi-run executable < /executable-config.yaml

Advanced GnuPG
- no Perfect Forward Secrecy in OpenPGP
- streamed based, packet protocol, allows for low memory usage on a large body of data
- openpgp supports not revealing the id of the private key that can decode the data with an extension
- `| gpg2 --list-packets`
- public key contains preferred algorithms
- should be periodically exporting public key and pushing to keyservers
- GPG is not a library, GPGME(made easy) is a library
- these use process seperation to isolate bugs in your software with GPG
- `pinentry` uses a simple, readable IPC called Assuan. Should use pinentry in other projects.
- recommends PGP Biometric word list and Voice of America's simple english wordlist over diceware's
- "key signing parties are for geeks"
- `gpg2 --with-icao-spelling --fingerprint ?`
- gpg supports tofu now, just like ssh
- should use something like `parcimonie` to refresh the public keys I know about.
- exclude .gnupg/random_seed from backups
- Always use a short expiration, built in failsafe revocation, forces users to refresh keys
- can use GnuPG and smartcard to provide ssh keys
- ssh -L can forward unix domain sockets!!!
- slides on gnupg.org
- recommend the GnuK smartcard

State of GnuPG
- new default focus
  - mass surveillance
  - easy of use
