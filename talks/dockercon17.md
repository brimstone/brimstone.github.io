Moby Project
------------

![](dockercon17/moby-project-logo.png)


Docker is, and will remain, a open source product that lets you build, ship and run containers. It is staying exactly the same from a user’s perspective. Users can download Docker from the docker.com website.

Note: https://mobyproject.org/#moby-and-docker


Moby is a project which provides a “Lego set” of dozens of components, the framework for assembling them into custom container-based systems, and a place for all container enthusiasts to experiment and exchange ideas.
