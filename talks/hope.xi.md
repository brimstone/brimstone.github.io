The Eleventh HOPE will take place on July 22, 23, and 24, 2016 at the Hotel Pennsylvania in New York City. H.O.P.E. stands for *Hackers On Planet Earth*, one of the most creative and diverse hacker events in the world. *It's been happening since 1994*.

Note: There you'll find:
- hackerspace villages
- film screenings
- Segway rides
- lock picking villages
- art installations

- robots
- an amateur radio station
- electronics workshops
- and the country's biggest supply of Club-Mate
