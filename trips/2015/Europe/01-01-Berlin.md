######Fri Jan  01

We woke up after 11am, catching up on sleep from yesterday. K got a small breakfast, I got a shower and caught up at the lunch of roast chicken and veggies. We hung out for a bit, then dressed for the cold weather and headed out for the day. Our first stop was Nord Bahnhof, the rail station used to access all trains headed north of the city many years ago. During WWII, the wall ran through this area. There's still bits of the wall, plaques, and memorials near the station.

After looking around for a bit, we continued to Brandenburger Tor, the iconic gate separating east and west Berlin. There were still a ton of people and fences setup from the NYE celebration last night. We walked through the gate then started our journey back. The youngest fell asleep and got in a short nap.

Back at the apartment, we had a snack, tea, coffee, and lit a few more Eissternen.

After dinner, we chatted about plans for our remaining time here and played with the boy's Christmas toys, everything they think we do when they sleep.
