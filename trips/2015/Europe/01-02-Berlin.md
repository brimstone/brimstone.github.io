######Sat Jan  02

Today started with great plans to go into the TV tower, another popular tourist destination. However, it was too cloudly and since we didn't get tickets online the night before, we just hung out with the boys in the apartment. K's sister ran out to get groceries for the next few days and K's brother-in-law picked up K's other nephew to give K's brother an easier time preparing for his upcoming trip.

Lunch was noodles, pesto, and leftover roasted root vegetables from a yesterday's lunch. After lunch, K and her sister went to check out the Bulhaben factory. I stayed back at the appartment with K's brother-in-law and all nephews.
