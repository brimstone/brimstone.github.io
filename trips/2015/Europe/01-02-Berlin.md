######Sat Jan  02

Today started with great plans to go into the TV tower, another popular tourist destination. However, it was too cloudy and since we didn't get tickets online the night before, we just hung out with the boys in the apartment. K's sister ran out to get groceries for the next few days and K's brother-in-law picked up K's other nephew to give K's brother an easier time preparing for his upcoming trip.

Lunch was noodles, pesto, and leftover roasted root vegetables from a yesterday's lunch. After lunch, K and her sister went to check out the Bollhagen factory. I stayed back at the appartment with K's brother-in-law and all nephews.

K's brother and sister-in-law came over to pick up their son. They brought a cake and stayed for coffee and tea. After they left, we cleaned up and prepared for dinner. K's brother-in-law had two friends over, that they had lived with for a while several years back. A dinner of beef stew, red wine, and conversation took us into the night.
