01/03 Berlin
------------
######Sun Jan  03

We got up at a reasonable time. Our plan was for me to get a shower and us to get out of the apartment by 10:30. The temperature still below freezing from last night, with windchill, it felt like 1Â°C while we were out. We planned to attend the WWII bunker tour at 11, but when we got there at 5 till, they were already sold out of tickets. We instead purchased tickets for the 13:00 tour that was not listed on their site or flyers. We went back to the apartment and got a quick lunch. We arrived about 5 minutes before 13:00, and there was a crowd of more than 60 people already grouped together. The tour split in two groups and began. My notes follow:

We returned to the appartment in the freezing cold weather. The parents of K's brother-in-law were there visiting before taking care of the kids for the next two days. K and here sister were dead set on making Neuejahreskuchen, kind of a small, very thin, crispy pancake, rolled into a cone. We went out for coffee and cake at the Ampelmann Cafe with the friends from last night. K and I bought an Amplemann ornament and each a bottle opener. I'm going to drill a hole in mine to make it into a keychain. We went to dinner at Dudu 31, a Vietnamese/Japanese fusion place. We returned to the appartment, in the freezing cold weather. We hung out for a bit, catching up on our digital lives and I got to use my bottle opener. Did I mention it was cold outside today?
