######Mon Jan  04

We slept in some, since the major events planned were for K to make soup, us to use the balloon voucher K's sister-in-law gave us for Christmas, buy chocolate to take home, and to all meet up for sushi for dinner. We had a lazy morning, K wrapped up soup making in time for us to have some for lunch. I should have caught up on notes, but instead I caught up on email and other electronic tomfoolery. It was still vacation after all. I cleaned the kitchen and watched TV while K tried to take a nap. About 2:15 we left the house for the balloon ride. We bundled up again, today forecasted to be colder than yesterday.

The balloon was right down the street from Checkpoint Charlie. When we got there, we saw the sign stating that the balloon was grounded due to high winds, especially at 150 meters. Slightly bummed, we continued down the street and found the Topologies of Terror exhibit that had free admission. We went in there and started looking around. K was frustrated by the large number of people in the exhibit and by not being able to go in the balloon. We looked online for other free things to do in Berlin, but didn't find anything else close, and the exhibit we were in turned up a few times. We decided to stay a while longer and look around. Neither of us had enough soup to make it to dinner, so when we were done, we decided to get a coffee and a snack or our sushi dinner would be expensive. K found westberlin, a coffeeshop nearby that looked like the also had reasonable food.

I ordered a noodle salad snack and a hot chocolate, K a coffee and German cheesecake. Everything but the hot chocolate was given to us quickly, which would be brought out to us. After we had consumed everything we had ordered, K went to the counter and asked about the hot chocolate. They made one fresh and brought it out, along with a sympathy cookie. I consumed the hot chocolate and K helped consume the cookie. We then bundled back up for the bitter cold, colder now that the sun had gone down and headed towards the closest UBahn station, to buy chocolate!

We went to a Kaufland on that side of town. It was pretty big and intimidating, everything in another language and not arranged how an American would think. We managed to find everything on our list, but it was too late to stop by the apartment before sushi, so we headed towards dinner instead.

We met K's sister and brother-in-law at ishin? It was a nice, canteen-esk sushi place. They had good miso soup, rolls, nigiri, and green tea. After dinner, we Ubahned back to the appartment with K's brother-in-law. We made a stop at a Rossman's to get fuel for the Fuerestanbowele and peruse their chocolate selection. They didn't have any additional good chocolate. We returned through the bitter cold to the appartment, arriving just after K's sister who traveled by bike.

I jumped in the shower and K gathered everything that was ours and other things we were going to bring back. I then started to pack our bags and K grabbed a shower. I fought with the scale a little, switching it to pounds and figuring out how to get it to give me an accurate measurement. I filled K's bag to the 50lb limit and mine weighed in at 44lbs. We would be close on weight at the airport.

Back in the living room, the owners had setup for another run of the Fuerestanbowele. The rum wine punch, Haribo gummybears, Ritter Sport, and remembering times with Flickr pictures polished off the night. We turned in after 11pm, knowing full well we wouldn't start our next long day with enough sleep.
