This morning we left the flat early to feast on another one of London's token meals, A Full and Proper English Breakfast. There was a lot of meat. We finished up one postcard since we had enough time. We also got to experience the tube during the morning rush hour.

After breakfast we headed to the starting location of another tour. This also placed us very close to a famous address in London: 221B Baker Street.

Baker street didn't extend to this address when Sir Arthur Conan Doyle wrote about Sherlock Holmes, but when Baker street was extended, the museum was allowed to claim that address. Mr Holmes apparently still gets a lot of fan mail.

We went on a tour of London's Underground tube system. K took a bunch of notes here which I still need to get from her. I'll update this section once I get them. Each tube station has a map, created by an artist for one of the anniversaries. Pictured here are two of them:

We had a hearty lunch at The Cafe In The Crypt, under/next to the church, St. Martin-in-the-fields. After we headed back across the Waterloo bridge, one we had crossed the day before. It started to rain on our way to the London Eye, but we didn't turn back and continued as the rain wasn't very heavy. We took a 30 minute ride up and around the London Eye, taking many pictures of the sights around London from this unique vantage point.

I had wanted some [Clubemate](http://www.clubmate.de/) and I had found that Portobello Wholefoods was the only place close that had some. It was fast approaching their closing time, so we stopped by a closer Wholefoods and looked there with the intent of also getting something to make for dinner back at the flat.

The Wholefoods we found was enormous. Three levels, the top being a food court of sorts. We ended up just eating there. I got a burrito! We also picked up a few local beers for later in the week. Our local Wholefoods really needs to step up its game.

After Wholefoods, The Experienceâ„¢, we returned to the flat.
