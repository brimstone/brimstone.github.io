12/10 London
------------
######Thu Dec 10

We started with breakfast at the flat again. We left late enough that our first stop was lunch at a place called Tossers. They're the same kinda fast prepared food place, just pick up something from the counter, pay for it, and go. This was in a fairly businessy area of town.

Our first event of the day was to tour the Geffrye Museum. In the museum, there were several rooms set in different periods of London's history. It was neat to see the "floor treatments," table place settings, and interior decorations going back to the 1600s. They had a special exhibit of rooms from different periods dressed for christmas. It was funny to see a room from the 2000s. It's hard to believe 2000 was fifteen years ago.

K found the best coffee so far at Curious Yellow Kafé right around the corner from the museum. More adventures were in store for us in the tube coming back. It was rush hour and very crowded. We hit our daily limit again, which means travel for our activities this evening are free. We went back at the flat for K to catch up on work, and I caught up on notes and laundry.

After, we went back out to Craft Beer Co. We got drinks, but didn't get food. It was very wet, a little rainy outside as we attempted dinner at a few places, but everywhere was so full! We ended up at 155. The service was poor, but the host made up for it by getting us free cocktails. I had a dirty burger, which is a burger with some sort of slaw. K got raviolli.

On our way back, we stopped by a Tesco, and the Waitrose right next door to it, looking for sugar and breakfast items. Back at the flat, we had Gü for dessert.
