######Fri Dec 11

Again we started with breakfast at the flat. K had to get some work done in the morning. I dried our laundry and picked out lunch and dinner places. On the tube ride to lunch, we got a show from Steve and Brian. Mass transit at home just doesn't have the same buskers as London and Berlin. Lunch was at Itsu, a fast food sushi place. While trying to find the entrance to our next tour, the Churchill War Rooms, we took a scenic tour around Westmister Square.

- Toured the Churchill War Rooms
