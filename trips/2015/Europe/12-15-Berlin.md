12/15 Berlin
------------
######Tue Dec  15

Today started an hour and a half earlier for K than me when our nephew came into our room and announced that breakfast was over. K got up and helped keep him out of our room while I continued to sleep. After they left, K got some work done super early EST. I got up and had breakfast then we played a few rounds of the Dominion mobile game.

Lunch was at a local place. I ordered what amounted to Dönor meat with Mexican cheese, served boiling. K ordered a soup and salad. I think we know who got the better deal.

After lunch, we took a tram to pick up our nephew from Kita. We attempted to take him to a nearby animal zoo, but they closed early and we got there after they closed. We settled for some time at a nearby playground, then headed back by tram. Someone skipped his nap today, whick made him extra fidgety on the tram and when we got home. Dinner was very German with würstchen, vegetables, cheese, and bread. K and I went head to head in about 4 rounds of Dominion then she had to work more and I worked on these notes.
