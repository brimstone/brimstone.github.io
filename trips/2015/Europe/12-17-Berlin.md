- Breakfast of brötchen and meat or cheese.
- K wraps presents as I pack our bags

- Up 7 flights of stairs with two ~20kg bags and backpacks
- We pick up items for a sick grandmother

- Our next stop was Toys R Us, to purchase an Artic LEGO set as a gift to the brother-in-law heading to the antarctic and his son.
- We then purchase and drop off more tea, instant soup, and kleenex for the grandmother.
- We return to the party at K's sister's as everyone is just getting home for the day
- We have some cake and tea while the youngest have a dinner of soup.
- Laundry is started as we need to have everything washed before our week long excursion to Linstow
- We met some of K's brother-in-law's friends for dinner at a nice but touristy French restaurant a few subway stops away. I had what amounted to a ham sammich covered in melted cheese. K had some growth organ from a calf. The whole city is unseasonably warm causing the restaurant to also be overly warm. After dinner we walked a bit to a "hipster bar." I had a dark beer and K had her usual gin & tonic.
- We headed back to K's sister's, releave the babysitting grandfather and turn in for the night.
