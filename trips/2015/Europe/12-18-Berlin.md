12/18 Berlin
------------
######Fri Dec  18

Slow day at K's sister's. We slept in, then had breakfast, and started making cookies. We made M&M pretzels with Ritta Sport but they're not the same as Hersey's Kisses. We also prepped coconut balls. We had soup for lunch. I didn't find any Ks in my soup. I also didn't find any letters that the English alphabet doesn't have so I doubt the Germanness of them. K laid down for a nap and I caught up on notes and added an index page to this site. When K woke up, we had tea.

We hung out at the appartment for a bit, then when to a korean restaurant in the same building for the amazing experience that was Firegrill. Basically, beef, onion, mushrooms, and peppers were cooked on a table top grill right in front of us.
