12/20 Berlin

######Sun Dec  20

- We were awoken with a knock. K's brother wanted to leave to go flying soon and K wanted to go with him. We got up and shuffled into the kitchen to find everyone outside receiving the children that were with the grandparents yesterday and the other grandparents were dropping off their rental car for us to pack. The next 2 hours were a blur of eating, packing our bags, and helping load the cars. K's father had left his wallet at their rental appartment accidentally and we worked out its retrieval. Lunch was milk rice, which is a shortgrain rice cooked with milk. The rise is topped with cherries at the table. The resident boys had received a shot of Coca-Cola for Thanksgiving, because that's American. I got to finish the bottle with a little whiskey, but I had to use a mug so it looks like coffee. The boys layed down for a nap and we picked up the toys in the living room and played Dominion on our devices.
