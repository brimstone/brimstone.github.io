######Tue Dec  22

- Breakfast at the buffet
- A Christmas Tree was purchased the day before and delivered while the boys were out. This is a surprise to them.
- K's sister and brother-in-law drove to a near by city to get supplies.
- After breakfast K and her sister-in-law decorated the tree. 
- Before lunch, I tried setting up the repeater upstairs in the house that could read the wireless network. I couldn't reach my router from our house.

Lunch was left over noodles and some salami. Everyone still left but me laid down for a nap. It's been a little rainy this morning, more just spitting moisture than actual rain.

K's sister returned with groceries and I helped unload. They brought me back a full liter of Coke, since I had expressed interest in the Coke at K's sister's appartment. I spent the next while trying to figure out how to acquire enough whisky or rum for a liter of Coke. We hung out with the parents in the big house until the grandparents returned with the boys. Our next venture was lunch in shifts to minimize the audience while the 4 year olds ate.

On the way back from dinner, K and I walked around the little road a few times to get some fresh air. It was a little cold, dark, and 100% humidity without actually raining, but that was ok. When we returned, we got a beer, had some chocolate, then went to our house and went to bed.
