12/22 Linstow
-------------
######Tue Dec  22

- Breakfast at the buffet
- A Christmas Tree was purchased the day before and delivered while the boys were out. This is a surprise to them.
- K's sister and brother-in-law drove to a near by city to get supplies.
- After breakfast K and her sister-in-law decorated the tree. 
- Before lunch, I tried setting up the repeater upstairs in the house that could read the wireless network. I couldn't reach my router from our house.

Lunch was left over noodles and some salami. Everyone still left but me laid down for a nap. It's been a little rainy this morning, more just spitting moisture than actual rain.
