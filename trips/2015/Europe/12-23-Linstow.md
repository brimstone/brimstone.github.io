12/23 Linstow
-------------
######Wed Dec  23

We got up early enough to see everyone at breakfast, but they also stayed late to go swimming first thing, when the pool opened at 10. We also brought our swim gear and two 1â‚¬ coins for the lockers.
- Lunch was soup
- Played Settlers while others took a nap and went swimming
- Dinner was buffet again, but at a new section that was open because so many people showed up that afternoon
