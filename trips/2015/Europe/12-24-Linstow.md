12/24 Linstow
-------------
######Thu Dec  24

Breakfast in the Italianish restaurant. We took one kid swimming because he liked it so much while the rest went on a hike to a Tower in Krakow.

Lunch was Eierkuchen, an egg pancake of some sort, sorta crepe-ish.  While the boys napped, we played one game of Settlers in the afternoon, with the island expansion. I didn't win that one either. We changed into nicer clothes. The younger kids woke up from their naps. We sang several Christmas songs and K's brother-in-law read the bible version of the Christmas Story, in German. K's grandmother handed out presents from German Santa Claus. Everyone opened presents and played with them for a bit before we cleaned up and headed to dinner. A named table and a fish buffet awaited us in the main building. We finished dinner about 8pm.

After dinner, more playing with presents and hanging out. We lit the candles on the tree too. The kids went to bed late. Stockings were then stuffed by the American Santa. We discussed the days events and plans for the remainder of our time in Linstow.
