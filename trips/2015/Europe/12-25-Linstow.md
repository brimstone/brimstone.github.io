######Fri Dec  25

- Breakfast at the hotel again
- half of the group went swimming
- we played with the youngest boy
- K went for a run
- lunch was fish and potatoes and salad. First day we didn't run out of planned lunch foods.
- We played same balancing game and Carcassonne while others napped. One boy went to the pool one last time.
- I packed our stuff and K took the other two boys to the playground in the dark. They built sand castles by the light of their iPhones.
- After that we went to dinner in the land of buffets. We finally managed to facetime my parents, then walked back to the big house and hung out for the rest of the evening. We drank some beer, ate some chocolate and cookes, and looked at some pictures of the trip. We turned in later than we should have, both of us were yawning the next day.
