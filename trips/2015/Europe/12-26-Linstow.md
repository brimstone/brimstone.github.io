12/26 Linstow
-------------
######Sat Dec  26

- We got up way too early, 8am, and finished packing our bags then moved them into position for packing into the car later.
- We met the others for breakfast, then I headed back to help K's brother-in-law pack while K kept an eye on her nephew.
- K's father drove us to the nearest train station in Laldendorf.

*We sat here for 30 minutes*

- The station in BÃ¼tzow had nothing for amenities, being the second day of Christmas and all. I failed to pack any lunch or snack for us except for 2 beers, so a liquid lunch was had.
