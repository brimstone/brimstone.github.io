12/26 Linstow
-------------
######Sat Dec  26

- We got up way too early, 8am, and finished packing our bags then moved them into position for packing into the car later.
- We met the others for breakfast, then I headed back to help K's brother-in-law pack while K kept an eye on her nephew.
- K's father drove us to the nearest train station in Laldendorf.

*We sat here for 30 minutes*

- The station in Bützow had nothing for amenities, being the second day of Christmas and all. I failed to pack any lunch or snack for us except for 2 beers, so a liquid lunch was had.
- Our final destination was Hamburg Hauptbahnhof. The last time we were here was during our honeymoon last year. We grabbed a late lunch in the same food court, but at an Indian place this time. After a quick fight with the SBahn ticket machine, we were off to our hotel. We checked in, then watch a movie and K took a quick nap. She had made reservations the day before at a place called Blockbräu, a brewpub of sorts. I ordered the closest thing to a hamburger they had, and it came with neat little ketchup and mayo packets.

Our next stop was the 32C3 congress ticket desk to beat the line tomorrow and get my wristband now. We walked around the congress some too so K could get a feel of what she would be missing these next 4 days.

We returned to the hotel and after some fighting with my laptop, watched the Dr Who Christmas Special then turned in for the night.
