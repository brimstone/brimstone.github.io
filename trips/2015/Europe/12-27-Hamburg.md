12/27 Hamburg
-------------
######Sun Dec  27

I got up and jumped in the shower while K ran out to a le Crocetbag and got breakfast. We ate in the hotel room and then I headed out to the first day of [32c3](../../../events/2015/12/32c3.md) while she mulled about the hotel, doing K like things.

My lunch was a hot box of noodles and chicken from Asia Hung. K went to two Christmas markets, and hung out at the hotel.

We met up for dinner and drinks at Down Under, an Austrailian pub.
