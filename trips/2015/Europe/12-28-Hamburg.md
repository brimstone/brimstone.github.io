12/28 Hamburg
-------------
######Mon Dec  28

Day two of [32c3](../../../events/2015/12/32c3.md) for me.

Breakfast was from Edeka right down the street. They also have Club Mate there for €1.05 instead of the €2.50 from the Congress bar. K and I met for a late lunch at Das Bistro. I had a tomato based pasta dish with a crazy Italian name.

K went for a walk in the park near by. She saw the planetarium during her walk.

I had a simple dinner of a pretzel and a crepe from vendors at the Congress. K sushi and soup for dinner. Probably better than mine, but crepes are really tasty!

We turned in late that night, half preparing for new years, half just being adults.
