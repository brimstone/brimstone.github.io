12/29 Hamburg
-------------
######Tue Dec  29

Day three of [32c3](../../../events/2015/12/32c3.md) for me.

On our way to breakfast, we stopped at Edeka again and I got more Club Mate. We also found the pfand return. Breakfast was from one of the vendors at the SBahn stop next to Congress. K wanted to get going early so she could make it to a free tour of Hamburg on time. I had a Nusskrinkle. Later I realized that Nuss in German means nuts, and I basically got a super nutty pastry.

K took aforementioned free tour of Hamburg and learned a lot I didn't know. We met at that same SBahn station, Dammtor, and walked to Waku Waku for lunch. I got a chicken mango curry dish that was pretty good. It wasn't hot spicy, just thirsty spicy. Yesterday, I apparently got behind on water intake and tried to make up for it today. K bought me a 1.5L bottle of water to consume today. I got most of it down before I got back to the hotel this evening.

We met one more time at the SBahn station in the evening for a late dinner around 9pm. We each had a burger shaped item from SMOX, who, while having tasty pulled pork and sweet potato fries, also had questionable cleanliness.
