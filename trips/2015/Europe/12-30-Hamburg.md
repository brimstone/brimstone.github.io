12/30 Hamburg
-------------
######Wed Dec  30

We got up early and made our way to Miniatur Wunderland.  This is a magical place in the warehouse district of Hamburg. They have tons of figurines, trains, planes, buildings, boats, cows, santas, and even more. Everything is HO scale, or 1:87 scale. The attention to detail is amazing. The lights overhead were even configured to simulate a redish purple dusk, night, and blue sunrise from one side, then they went back to full daylight. All along the railings, there were buttons that triggered different lights, cars, jackhammers, space shuttles, or hot air balloons. They had even decorated each region for Christmas. Little Santa figures and lit Christmas trees were everywhere.

Lunch was just across the bridge, back in the flood safe zone. Two years ago, 2013, the warehouse district flooded. We ate at a little coffeeshop. I had potato salad and Frikadelle, a ground beef patty lightly breaded and fried. The building is on Deichsta√üe, the same street where the original fire of 1842 started. 

We traveled by aboveground subway and train (sbahn) back to the hotel. I gathered our used glass and plastic bottles, claimed a Pfand return at the local Edeka, picked up a Club Mate for the day, and headed off to day 4 of 32c3. K hung out at the hotel, napping, reading, and working out at the little gym in the hotel.

I got back in time for dinner. We went to a Thai/Asia place called bok, just on the otherside of the SBahn station closest to the hotel. I had chicken and noodles, K had some fish dish.

Back at the hotel, we watched a documentary about plane crashes in German and packed our bags for the next morning.
