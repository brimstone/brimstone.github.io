12/31 Hamburg
-------------
######Thu Dec  31

We slept in some, ate a few clementines, checked out of the hotel and started our journey back to Berlin. We went two stations out, the same SBahn station as the Congress, and grabbed a quick breakfast. We weren't quick enough, sadly, and due to a time confusion missed our ICE train that went almost nonstop to Berlin.

K asked at the ticket counter about other options.  Since day of ICE tickets are more than 3x our original tickets,  K got us tickets on a regional train that's slower, cheaper, doesn't have a quiet car, transfers once and stops, at, every, station. We continued on to the Hamburg HBF, the central train station for Hamburg. I got a Dürüm Döner and K got a mug of Glühwein. Our first train was a little late to our transfer point. K said that doesn't mean we get to ride for free. She didn't have enough time to get a coffee or a snack before we had to board our connecting train. I had a slight panic as our connecting train went back to two of the stops our first train visited, but K confirmed we were headed the right way.
