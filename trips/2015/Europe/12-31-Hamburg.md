12/31 Hamburg

######Thu Dec  31

We slept in some, ate a few clementines, checked out of the hotel and started our journey back to Berlin. We went two stations out, the same SBahn station as the Congress, and grabbed a quick breakfast. We weren't quick enough, sadly, and due to a time confusion missed our ICE train that went almost nonstop to Berlin.

K asked at the ticket counter about other options.  Since day of ICE tickets are more than 3x our original tickets,  K got us tickets on a regional train that's slower, cheaper, doesn't have a quiet car, transfers once and stops, at, every, station. We continued on to the Hamburg HBF, the central train station for Hamburg. I got a Dürüm Döner and K got a mug of Glühwein. Our first train was a little late to our transfer point. K said that doesn't mean we get to ride for free. She didn't have enough time to get a coffee or a snack before we had to board our connecting train. I had a slight panic as our connecting train went back to two of the stops our first train visited, but K confirmed we were headed the right way. 

K's brother-in-law and one nephew picked us up from the train station. We crashed at their place until we left the country. Officially, the fireworks were not allowed to start before 6pm. New Year's Eve in Berlin is akin to a warzone. There's a constant popping and booming of fireworks outside until sometime New Year's day. The rest of the family was just starting the New Year's Eve festivities when we arrived. First, they had stuck an Eisstern (ice cream mounted sparkler) in half of a small potato and set it on a plate. After that, we lit Wunderkertzen (sparklers) on the patio.

Pre-dinner drinks was Feuerzangenbowle, a rum infused sugar cone suspended above a bitter concoction of orange juice, lemon juice, red wine, and cloves. The sugar cone was then lit and after the sugar had crystalized and completely dripped into the mix, it was consumed by the adults. It tasted a lot like Glühwein. The kinds had Kinderpunsch, a warm juice. Dinner was Raklette, a do it yourself meal of small plates, covered in hot cheese.

After the kids went to bed, we headed out to Humboldthain, a nearby club for a few hours to ring in the new year. On our way out, we dodged several groups launching, swinging, and dropping fireworks in the streets. On our way back, we dodged the spent fireworks and packaging carnage along the street and every corner.

We finally turned in after 2:30am.
